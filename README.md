## 📋 Description

This project is the final submission for **Task 5: Finalization, Deployment, and Presentation** as part of the 45-Day Android Internship at **ApexPlanet Software Pvt. Ltd.**

In this task, I finalized the app developed during the internship by refining its UI/UX, ensuring all core features worked seamlessly, and preparing it for deployment. I also wrote comprehensive documentation and recorded a demo presentation to summarize the entire development journey.

### ✅ Final Features Implemented:
- 🔐 **User Login** with basic validation
- 💾 **Session management** using `SharedPreferences`
- 🔔 **Push notification** on successful login
- 👋 **Dashboard screen** with logout capability
- 🎨 Polished and responsive UI layouts
- 📄 Clean project structure and documented code
- 🧪 Final testing and debugging

This task wrapped up the internship project by combining all previous tasks into a functional and stable Android application that simulates a real-world app experience. It also helped me learn how to structure an app for **presentation, submission**, and **future deployment.**
